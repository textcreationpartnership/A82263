         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration to the Kingdome, of the Armies generall ſurvey of the accompts of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize, the Cuſtoms, the Kings Revenue, the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Goldſmiths Hall, and the Receipts of Committees in London, and ſeverall Counties of this Kingdome.</head>
            <p>HAving by Gods bleſſing and the endeavours of this diſperſed Army overcome the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible actors of their own and the Kingdomes ruine, it pleaſed him to put into their thoughts to uſe ſuch waies and means as he ſhall dictate to them in a time of extremity and danger, for ſetling this long oppreſſed Nation in their juſt Rights and Priviledges, and upon the approach of ſome Regiments of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into the City of London, his Excellencie with the advice of his Generall Councell of the Army, gave Orders for the ſeizing of certain Treaſuries within the ſaid City, (they being as yet much in arreare for the Aſſeſſements to the Army) and coming to Weavers-Hall they found a conſiderable ſum of mony, which in probability was part of the money collected upon the Aſſeſſements to aforeſaid, however it might be otherwiſe pretended, which money by his Exeellencies Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that not only the Kingdome, but the whole world may judge of the juſtneſſe of his proceedings,) is to be reſtored againe without loſſe, or to be made
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162496:3"/>good out of that which is yet due to the Army, and was paid in by the middle ſort of people, which we hope will ſatisfie all reaſonable men that the intent of this Army is not to take or act any thing by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but what is theirs and the Kingdomes due; for however it may be alleadged that this act was to make proviſion to pay the private ſouldier, yet is it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeciall regard to the peoples intereſt, for it is too well knowne that if the ſouldier hath not his pay he is unable to diſcharge his Quarters, which cauſeth many deepe ſighs and groanes from the poore Farmer in the Country, who (with us) have long had a perticuler aſpect on the City of London in hopes of redreſſe, for that it is notoriouſly knowne, that it is the only place of receipt and the publique treaſury of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And when we examine the income of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize only, it amazeth us to think that the Eſtates of Holland ſhould maintain a far greater Army then this in conſtant pay (the Excize being no higher there then it is there) by that alone. But when you conſider the other vaſt ſummes of money, which for ſeverall yeares together have accrued out of this Office, the Cuſtome, Houſe, (and other the Kings Revenue) Compoſition money, the ſale of Biſhops Lands, ſequeſterations in all parts of the Kingdome, &amp;c. and yet all too little either to ſatisfie publique debts, or pay the deerly ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wages of the ſouldiers, it muſt neceſſarily follow that a great part of ſuch moneyes were converted to a contrary uſe, or not that improvement made thereof as might beſt advantage the publique; which hath cauſed us and our friends to conſider of theſe perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:162496:3"/>
               <item>1. That the Aſſeſſements for this Army were either not gathered, or deteined on purpoſe to bring the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into diſdain, and render them odious unto the Kingdome.</item>
               <item>2. That the accompts of the Excize are unperfect, or not kept in that forme which is requiſit for that and other Officers of like nature, the experience of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too plainly appearing by the delaies that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly been uſed, when they have been called on to bring an accompt which could hardly ever yet be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or brought to juſt eſtimate under 6. Moneths; within which time there commonly happened ſome extraordinary oceaſion for a great ſumme, and if this upon earneſt requeſt were advanced, it muſt be repaid with 8. l. per centum, which together with the large al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to the Commiſſioners, and Sub-Officers, there comes not de claro above one moitie to the State.</item>
               <item>3. That the Cuſtoms taken, or Tunnage &amp; Poundage and the revenue of the Kings Land, brings a vaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the State, and ſome part thereof is unaccompted for, and the Cuſtomes which were heretofore declared to be for the maintenance of the Navy, not ſufficient to defray that charge, but large ſummes of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and otherwiſe have been added towards that ſervice.</item>
               <item>4. That before the time of the riſing in Kent (and the Earle of <hi>Hollands</hi> party) there was at leaſt three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand pounds due, from ſuch as had already made their compoſitions and entred bond to pay it at ſuch a day, which moneyes not being brought in was made uſe of as an inablement to thoſe perſons in whoſe hands it remained, the more deeply to ingage in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162496:4"/>laſt War, and of that which was brought in, many great ſummes thereof were given away as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or reward to particuler perſons which had no need thereof, whilſt others which had faithfully ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Parliament were ready to famiſh with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</item>
               <item>5. That for Biſhops Lands if they have not been ſold at an under value, yet hath not that benefit been gained thereby as ſuited with the neceſsity to ſupply the publique affaires, for it is a thing which few are unſenfible of, that ſome men being in equipage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to purchaſe, have made that good to themſelves which others have had ltttle cauſe to eſteem any better of then deſperate debts.</item>
               <item>6. It is not to be forgotten that as theſe places before mentioned are chiefly to be dived into, yet doth it no waies excuſe Committees in the Countreies or other Cities, or any perſon or perſons of what ſort or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162496:4"/>ſoever which may juſtly bee charged, neither is it to be underſtood that every Member or particuler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon officiating or appertaining to any of the Officers or Committees afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, are faulty or blameworthy for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſcarriages therein, <hi>For he that doth well ſhall be accepted</hi> both of God and man.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed as ſo many generalls, wherein is conceived there might be great redreſſe, nevertheleſſe it is hereby fit likewiſe to be declared, that the Army do not take on them by force or violence to regulate theſe or other matters of the ſame kinde, but freely leave it unto the honourable Houſe of Commons, and others in place of truſt and judicature; and no ſooner ſhall it pleaſe God to ſettle this Kingdom in peace, the Army ſecured by good and undoubted wayes from thoſe which have and will at all times hereafter (if it Ile in their power) ſeek their utter ruine, and bring a new diſturbance upon the whole Kingdome; and our dearly earned wages ſatisfied or ſecured, we ſhall moſt readily and willingly disband, and betake our ſelves to our former callings.</p>
            <p>And further, foraſmuch as a Party of Horſe did by miſtake march to the grand Excize, although no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or injury offered, or money by them taken or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162496:5"/>yet many falſe reports were raiſed, whereupon the Lord Generall, to preſerve a right underſtanding, ſent a Letter to the Commiſſioners of Excize in theſe words.</p>
